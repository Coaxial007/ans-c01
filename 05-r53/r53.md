# Route 53

## Public Hosted Zones

- A hosted zone is a DNS database for a given section of the global DNS database
- Route 53 is a globally resilient service. The nameservers are distributed globally and have the same dataset
- Hosted zones are created automatically if we register a domain
- We can create them separately if we want to register a domain elsewhere
- There is a monthly fee for the hosted zone and for the number of queries made to the hosted zone
- A zone hosts DNS records, example A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, etc.
- Hosted zones are authoritative for a domain, when we register a domain, nameserver records for it will enter into the top level domain zone, which will point to our nameservers. Our nameservers will become authoritative for that domain
- A public hosted zone is DNS database, a zone file hosted by R53 on public nameservers
- They are accessible from the public internet and form our VPCs
- When a public hosted zone is created, R53 allocates 4 nameservers for this hosted zone. These nameservers are accessible from the public internet and from the VPC is DNS is enabled
- From the VPC the access method is direct, the VPC resolver using the VPC +2 address
- From the public internet, we access the root zones first and proceed to walk the tree to get the IP for the DNS

## Private Hosted Zones

- Private hosted zones are similar to public hosted zones, but they are not public to the whole internet
- They are associated with VPCs, they can be only access within these VPCs
- We use them to create resource records which are resolvable from the VPCs
- It is possible to use split-view: we can use the same address for public and private DNS
- Split View/Split Horizon DNS:

## CNAME vs ALIAS

- In DNS an `A` records maps a `NAME` to an IP address, while a `CNAME` record maps a `NAME` to another name (example: `example.io` => `1.3.3.7` and `www.example.io` => `example.io`)
- We cannot use a `CNAME` for the apex domain
- Many AWS services, such as ELBs, do not provide an IP address, only a DNS name, so we can not point the apex domain to these services
- This problem is fixed by the `ALIAS` record
- An `ALIAS` record maps a `NAME` to an AWS resource
- It can be used for both apex and normal records, for non-apex records we can use `CNAME` records
- There is no charge for `ALIAS` requests pointing to an AWS resource
- An `ALIAS` record is a subtype, we can have `A` record alias and a `CNAME` record alias
- The `ALIAS` record is a record implement by AWS and it falls outside of the DNS standard

## Simple Routing

- Simple routing starts with a hosted zone
- With simple routing we can create one record per name
- Each record can have multiple values. For the client these records are returned and the client can chose one by random
- Limitation of simple routing is that it does not support health checks

## Health Checks

- Health checks are separate from, but they are used by records
- We configure them separately from records, they are used to evaluate the health of a 
- Health checks are performed by a fleet of health checkers globally, we need to allow them
- They can be used to check anything (not just AWS instances) on the internet
- Health checks are performed every 30s, we can have more granular health checks (at every 10s) at extra cost
- Checks can be TCP, HTTP/HTTPS (target should respond with a 200/300 status within 2 seconds), HTTP/HTTPS with String Matching (response body should also be received within 2 seconds)
- Based on these health checks and endpoint can be `Healthy` or `Unhealthy`
- Checks can be on these 3 types:
    - Endpoint checks: assess the health of an actual endpoint
    - CloudWatch Alarm: react to CloudWatch Alarms
    - Checks of other checks - calculated: monitors the application as a whole, involves the health status of individual app components

## Failover Routing

- With failover routing we can add multiple routing of the same name (primary and secondary)
- Each of these records points at a resource
- A common architecture is a to use failover for a "out of band" failure/maintenance page for a service
- Failover routing involves the presence of a health check
- If the target of the health check is healthy, the primary record is used, otherwise the traffic is directed to the secondary target
- Use case: active/passive failover

## Multi Value Routing

- It is a mixture of simple and failover routing
- With multi value routing we can create many records all with the same name
- Each of the records can have an associated health checks, when queried, up to 8 healthy records are returned to the client. If more than 8 exist, 8 are randomly selected
- Any of the record which fails the checks, wont be returned to the client and wont be selected to route traffic to
- Multi value routing is not a substitute for a load balancer, but it can improve the availability of the application by letting the client chose to which IP to connect

## Weighter Routing

- Can be used when we are looking for a simple form of load balancing or when we want to test new versions of a software
- With weighted routing we can specify a weight to each record
- For a given name, the total name is calculated. Each record will be returned based on its weighting compared to total weight
- Setting a record weight to 0, the record will never be returned
- Weighted routing can be combined with health checks
- **Health checks don't remove records from the calculation!** If an unhealthy record is selected, the selection will be retried until we get a healthy record
