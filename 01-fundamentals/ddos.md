- Distributed: hard to block individual IPs/ranges
- DDoS attacks generally fit in:
    - Application Layer attacks: HTTP Flood
    - Protocol based attacks: SYN Flood
    - Volumetric attacks: DNS Amplification
- DDoS attacks are often orchestrated by a small number of people who are in control of botnets
